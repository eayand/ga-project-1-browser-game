# Guess the Code (Mastermind)
This is my unit 1 project for General Assembly's software engineering course. 
Mastermind is a two-player boardgame that comes with handfuls of colored pegs. Out of the six different colors available, player 1 chooses four pegs and places them in a covered part of the board. These pegs can be all the same color, all different, or anything in between. Player 2 then chooses four pegs and places them in the first row of the board, trying to replicate player 1's sequence of colors. Next to this row are two feedback areas, one for showing the number of correct colors in the correct slots, and one for showing the number of correct colors not in the correct slots. (Think Wordle but with colors.) Player 1 places feedback pegs in these areas to show how many exact and partial matches appear in the first guess. This can be repeated until player 2 guesses the correct sequence and wins or fills in all the guessing rows with incorrect guesses and loses.
In this version, the computer is player 1, and you try to guess the code.
